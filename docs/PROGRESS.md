# Progress

Status values: Not Started / In Progress / Done (verified) / Blocked. "Done (verified)" means automated tests covering the item passed in the most recent session (`npm test`), and the production build succeeded (`npm run build`).

## Phase 0 - Inspect and plan (approved)

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Inspect project | Done | Vite 7 + React 19 + Tailwind 4, single-file static build; no backend, no database, no CI. |
| Verify hosting target | Blocked | Section 3 hosting fields are not in the uploaded material (Q-01). |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | Done | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
| ERD.md | Done | `docs/ERD.md`, with Mermaid diagram, constraints and exclusion constraints. |
| PERMISSIONS.md | Done | `docs/PERMISSIONS.md`. |
| STATE_MACHINES.md | Done | Vehicle, rental and trip machines in `docs/STATE_MACHINES.md`. Invoice, contract and incident machines Not Started. |
| KPIS.md | Done | RPT-01 implemented as a proposal; RPT-02 and RPT-03 Blocked on definitions and inputs. |
| DATA_PROTECTION.md | Done (draft) | Requires legal review. Retention periods unset (Q-18). |

## Phase 6 - Compliance documents (built this session, awaiting review)

Closes Q-16. Previously only already-expired driver licences were flagged; there were no
document types, no vehicle documents at all, and no advance-expiry warning.

Totals in this session: **89 tests passing** across 11 test files (unit tests for the core
service, busing, logistics, compliance and access scope, plus end-to-end UI flows for setup,
rentals, busing, logistics, compliance, the driver portal and the client portal). Typecheck
and production build clean.

## Phase 7 - Quality foundation: lint and CI (approved)

Closes the unmet Phase 0 deliverable "confirm that typecheck, lint, test and build all run".
No business facts were needed, so nothing is blocked on an open question.

|---|---|---|
| ESLint flat config (`eslint.config.js`): `@eslint/js` + `typescript-eslint` recommended, `react-hooks` | Done (verified) | `npm run lint` exits 0 |
| Correctness rules as errors: no-explicit-any, unused vars, eqeqeq, prefer-const, no-console, no-debugger | Done (verified) | `npm run lint` |
| Architectural rule enforced mechanically: UI may not import `execute*`/`executeCommand`, only `dispatch()` | Done (verified) | `no-restricted-imports` in `eslint.config.js` |
| Six baseline findings across six phases of code fixed (see D-28) | Done (verified) | All 89 tests still pass after the fixes |
| Route gating moved from effect-after-render to derived-during-render (no one-frame leak of an out-of-scope screen) | Done (verified) | `Portals.test.tsx` asserts forbidden nav is absent; D-29 |
| Actor ref synced in an effect, not during render (concurrent-render safety for `dispatch`) | Done (verified) | Every dispatch in the suite; D-29 |
| Persistence moved into `commit()` (synchronous, single write site) | Done (verified) | `App.test.tsx` asserts localStorage after writes; D-29 |
| `npm run lint` and `npm run check` (typecheck + lint + test + build) scripts | Done (verified) | `package.json` |
| CI workflow file running the same gates | Done (authored, **not executed**) | `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; no runner available here |
| Lint-on-commit hook | Not started | No git repository in this environment |

Totals in this session: **89 tests passing** across 11 test files; `npm run typecheck`,
`npm run lint`, `npm run build` and `npm audit --omit=dev` all clean.

| Day and km bases evaluated together, taking the most urgent | Done (verified) | `maintenance.test.ts` |
| Retired vehicles excluded from coverage; all-retired fleet reports no_vehicles | Done (verified) | `maintenance.test.ts` |
| Settings card, readiness screen, odometer log and dashboard notice | Done (verified) | `FleetReadiness.test.tsx` |
| Schema 6 to 7 migration never invents a legacy service | Done (verified) | `maintenance.test.ts` |

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Admin-configured expired quotation policy, no default (`revise_in_place` / `new_request`) | Done (verified) | `service.test.ts`, `Requote.test.tsx` |
| Renewal blocked before expiry, when policy unset, and when policy requires a new request | Done (verified) | `service.test.ts` |

Totals in this session: **109 tests passing** across 14 test files; `npm run check` and
`npm audit --omit=dev` (0 vulnerabilities) pass.

## Phase 10 - Progressive driver run execution (approved)

| Feature | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Dispatch -> in progress through assigned driver/operations start action | Done (verified) | `busing.test.ts`, `Portals.test.tsx` |
| Stop arrivals recorded one at a time, in route order, with monotonic actual times | Done (verified) | `busing.test.ts`, `Portals.test.tsx` |

| Boarding codes | Blocked | Q-19; manual outcome only |

Totals in this session: **112 tests passing** across 14 test files (three new progressive-flow
unit tests; the existing driver E2E now exercises the full progressive path). Final check and
production audit pass.

| Mid-trip changes noted in the audit summary with trip references, no personal data | Done (verified) | `busing.test.ts`, `Busing.test.tsx` |
| Driver next-stop form picks up roster changes live; no driver UI change needed | Done (verified) | `Busing.test.tsx` completion with mid-trip rider |
| No schema change; no migration | Done (verified) | Full `npm run check` green, no `migrate()` edit |
| Notify the driver when operations changes the roster mid-run | Blocked | No notification channel; driver sees it on the next stop form (Q-48) |

Totals in this session: **118 tests passing** across 14 test files (5 new unit tests, 1 new
operations E2E). `npm run check` and `npm audit --omit=dev` (0 vulnerabilities) pass.

## Not started (later phases)

- Contracts, invoices and a payments ledger. **Blocked:** contract activation requires billing
  frequency and payment terms (Q-CON-01), and invoice tax treatment is Q-FIN-02.
- Boarding codes (Q-19) and rider self-service.
- Document-expiry **notifications**: expiry status is now computed (Phase 6) but no reminder is
  sent, because no notification provider is configured. Notifications generally remain blocked.
- Data retention jobs and the Act 843 subject-request workflow.
